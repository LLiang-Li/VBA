Excel; Visual Basic for Applications.

There are two tools of VBA about Excel. The [First](https://github.com/LLiang-Li/VBA/tree/main/GUI_Delete_Same_Content_from_Other_Excel) is used to delete same content in different excel file. The [second](https://github.com/LLiang-Li/VBA/tree/main/Restore_Excel_Appearance) is used to show the unified format when the excel is opened.
